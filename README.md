# SARS-CoV-2 Gene Copies in Wastewater & K-12 Spread Prediction
##Project Overview
###The aim of this study is to predict the amount of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) gene copies in wastewater and understand the impact of its spread in K-12 schools. Using machine learning models and wastewater data, we hope to provide valuable insights into the spread of the virus in the community. This could help public health officials make informed decisions about school closures and re-openings.

Data Overview
The data used for this study includes data from conducted jointly by the New York City Department of Environmental Protection and the New York City Department of Health between 2020 and Spring, 20203.  This allows us to track the spread of the virus over time and across different geographical areas. To this data we added holiday and seasonal information, as well as data about K-12 schools, including the number of estimated number of students for each wastewater facility and school events during the first two years of the pandemic.

Methods
We used machine learning models to make our predictions, including models like decision trees and gradient boosting. We carefully validated our models using techniques such as cross-validation and grid search to ensure their accuracy and robustness. Finally, we used Bayesian modelling to ensure confidence in our predictions. 

Project Results
The results of our analysis showed that the amount of SARS-CoV-2 gene copies in wastewater is a useful indicator of the virus spread in the community. Most importantly, our models were able to make accurate predictions and estimate the contributions of schools to the overall SARS-CoV-2 wastewater levels.

Conclusion
Our study suggests that monitoring SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater and understanding its spread in schools can provide valuable information for public health decision-making. This could help prevent outbreaks and ensure the safety of students and staff in K-12 schools.

Next Steps
In the future, we plan to expand our analysis by including more variables and using more complex models. We also plan to apply our methods to other types of data, such as labor statistics (remote vs. in-person), population flux during 2020-2021, public transportation and restaurant usage, to get a more complete picture of the virus spread, especially after the Omicron wave.
